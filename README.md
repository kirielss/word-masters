## A Challenge presented by Brian Holt in Complete Intro to Web Dev V3 Course.

- https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/lessons/talking-to-servers/project

## The goal of the challenge is to train using GET and POST APIs in a real project

## PS: The code in this project is 100% mine
- I built this project from scratch and thought the logic all by myself, so I dont know how well it compares to other solutions to this problem.
